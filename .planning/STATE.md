# State

## Project Reference

- **Project:** Compass
- **Core value:** Users can quickly find and confidently understand authoritative incubator and accelerator terminology and related industry intelligence without insider knowledge.
- **Current focus:** Phase 3 execution: readable page standards, freshness cues, and content-structure normalization

## Current Position

- **Current phase:** 3 - Readable Intelligence Experience
- **Current plan:** Phase 3 standards are in place, the glossary readability sweep is substantially complete, and the KPI/publication normalization batch is well underway ahead of Wave 4 reading QA
- **Overall status:** Phase 3 in progress
- **Progress:** 2 / 4 phases complete

## Performance Metrics

- **Target product outcome:** Public thought leadership and lead generation
- **Primary user outcome:** Faster understanding of industry terminology and reference material
- **Primary business outcome:** More qualified top-of-funnel engagement for UBI Global

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2026-03-29 | V1 will be fully open access | The product is meant to serve external stakeholders, not primarily members |
| 2026-03-29 | Saved items and concept comparison are out of scope for v1 | Searchability and readability are the main priorities |
| 2026-03-29 | Success is defined primarily by thought leadership and lead generation | Compass is a public-facing strategic channel |
| 2026-03-29 | GitBook is the publishing layer, not the canonical source of truth | Editorial control should live outside the GitBook UI |
| 2026-03-29 | Repository Markdown is the canonical publishable source for Compass | GitBook works best when published from versioned Markdown content |
| 2026-03-29 | Google Docs or Drive may be used for drafting, but approved content should land in the repo before publish | Drafting convenience and publishing control are different needs |
| 2026-03-29 | Images should live with the published Markdown tree and video should usually be embedded from a stable public host | Editors need a clear and low-friction media workflow |
| 2026-03-29 | The legacy live GitBook structure is disposable and can be rebuilt from the repo | Structural clarity matters more than preserving old public URLs |
| 2026-03-29 | KPI detail pages should be renamed and organized around canonical metric names, not imported legacy slugs | The original GitBook export collapsed many KPI pages under misleading Jobs created and sustained paths |
| 2026-03-29 | Publications should be grouped by report type rather than inherited mixed GitBook categories | Readers need cleaner browse paths for benchmark reports, rankings reports, case studies, and ecosystem reports |
| 2026-03-29 | Phase 3 will improve readability through editorial structure and standards rather than a custom frontend layer | This repo publishes to GitBook and should optimize the reading experience through content design first |

## Assumptions

| Date | Assumption | Next Check |
|------|------------|------------|
| 2026-03-29 | Search should span glossary, KPI/metric, and report/publication content | Confirm in live GitBook verification follow-up |
| 2026-03-29 | GitBook Git Sync remains the preferred publishing mechanism | Verify in the deferred live GitBook sync pass |
| 2026-03-29 | Lead capture will be contextual rather than aggressively gated | Confirm during Phase 4 planning |

## Todos

- Finish the remaining KPI and publication normalization pages that still need the summary-first readability pattern
- Run a Phase 3 GitBook reading QA pass on representative glossary, KPI, and publication pages
- Keep the deferred GitBook sync verification pass available as an external follow-up

## Blockers

- None currently identified
