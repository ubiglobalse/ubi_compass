# GitBook Verification Checklist

## Goal

Verify that the rebuilt Compass repository publishes cleanly in GitBook and that the baseline discovery experience works across glossary, KPI, and publication content.

## Pre-Check

- Confirm GitBook is connected to `ubiglobalse/ubi_compass`
- Confirm the publishing branch is the intended branch
- Confirm `.gitbook.yaml` is present and GitBook is publishing from `docs/`

## Navigation Checks

- Confirm the home page resolves from `docs/README.md`
- Confirm the sidebar follows `docs/SUMMARY.md`
- Confirm the top-level sections are Glossary of Terms, KPIs & Metrics, and Publications & Reports
- Confirm category landing pages appear for glossary themes and publication/report types
- Confirm no duplicate legacy sections or unexpected orphan pages appear in the sidebar

## Search Checks

Run a few native GitBook searches and verify that results appear from more than one content type when relevant.

- Search `mentor`
  Expected: glossary content appears clearly
- Search `jobs created`
  Expected: KPI content appears clearly
- Search `world rankings`
  Expected: publication content appears clearly
- Search `esg`
  Expected: glossary and KPI-adjacent content both appear
- Search `benchmark`
  Expected: KPI framework and publication content both appear

For each result set, check that:

- The page title is recognizable and uses canonical language
- The opening snippet gives enough context to distinguish glossary, KPI, and publication pages
- The destination page matches the expected content type

## Page Spot Checks

- Open one glossary term and confirm the page starts with a clear definition and context
- Open one KPI page and confirm the page starts with a concise summary before longer detail sections
- Open one publication page with an image and confirm the media renders correctly
- Open one publication page with embedded video and confirm the embed works in the expected GitBook experience
- Follow at least one related link from a KPI or publication page and confirm cross-content discovery feels intact

## If Search Snippets Are Weak

- Improve the first one to three paragraphs of the affected page
- Tighten the H1 title and opening summary before changing structure
- Prefer fixing canonical repo Markdown before exploring any custom search solution

## Record The Outcome

- Note whether Git Sync worked without GitBook creating replacement files
- Note any sidebar mismatches versus `docs/SUMMARY.md`
- Note any searches that failed to surface the intended content type
- Feed the findings back into `.planning/STATE.md` before starting the next phase
